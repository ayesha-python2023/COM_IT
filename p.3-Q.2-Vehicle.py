# Write an algorithm (Vehicles.py) that, from reading and storing in vectors the commercial value of 20 vehicles and the type (family (1), 
# public transportation (2), load (3)), calculate the value based on:
# • For vehicles with a value greater than 100 million, charge VAT of 20%, for others VAT is 16%
# • For vehicles type 1, with value up to 50 million, apply a discount equivalent to 50% of the VAT charged
# • For vehicles type 2 and 3, with a value higher than 80 million, apply an additional cost of 5%
# • For all vehicles, if the final value is less than 80 million, apply an additional discount of 5% of the commercial value
