# Exercise 19: Write a Python program that does the following: declare a variable N of type int, 
# # a variable A of type double and a variable C of type char and assign to each one a value. The following screen displays:
# # The value of each variable. The sum of N + A. And A - N

N = int(5)                      
A = N * 2
C = chr()
SUM = (N + A) + (A - N)
print(SUM)
